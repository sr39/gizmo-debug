##  This is the current 'default' UV background table from 
##  Faucher-Giguere, 2020, MNRAS, 493, 2, 1614
##  'A cosmic UV/X-ray background model update', 
##  Appropriately modified following Onorbe et al., 2017, ApJ, 837, 2, 106, 
##  to reionize at the 'correct' target redshift [this owes to a difference in how the 
##  analytic models like Faucher-Giguere et al. treat the neutral fraction in the model, 
##  versus how in the simulations with a TREECOOL file the reionization background is 
##  applied -everywhere- uniformly, which can inadvertently lead to earlier reionization
##  than intended]. This also includes the updated contribution from AGN 
##  from Shen et al., 2020, arXiv:2001.02696, 
##    'The Bolometric Quasar Luminosity Function at z = 0-7'
##  If you wish to use this, delete these lines (pre-ceded by '##') and rename
##  the file simply TREECOOL, then include it in your run-time directory with the 
##  compiled GIZMO binary. 
##
## columns here are [see e.g. Fig 10 in Faucher-Giguere, 2020, MNRAS, 493, 2, 1614]:
##  (1) redshift: log_10(1+z)
##  (2) HI photoionization rate: Gamma_HI in s^-1
##  (3) HeI photoionization rate: Gamma_HeI in s^-1
##  (4) HeII photoionization rate: Gamma_HeII in s^-1
##  (5) HI photoheating rate: \dot{q}_HI in erg/s
##  (6) HeI photoheating rate: \dot{q}_HeI in erg/s
##  (7) HeII photoheating rate: \dot{q}_HeII in ergs/s
